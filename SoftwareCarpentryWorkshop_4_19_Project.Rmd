This is the final project for the UT Arlington Software Carpentry workshop on 4/19/2015.

First, we are looking at the gapMinder data for three countries, China, Canada, and Cuba.

```{r, include=FALSE}
#  Load libraries
library ("dplyr", verbose=FALSE)

#  Load Data from the file

gap.in <- read.table("output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", 
                     sep = "\t", 
                     header = TRUE)

#  China, Canada, Cuba Let's make a dataset for each with the year and GDP

gap.in %>%
  filter(country=="China") %>%
  select(year, gdpPercap) -> China

gap.in %>%
  filter(country=="Canada") %>%
  select(year, gdpPercap) -> Canada

gap.in %>%
  filter(country=="Cuba") %>%
  select(year, gdpPercap) -> Cuba
```

As you can see for China, the GDP has grown on an annual basis:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(China$year, China$gdpPercap, xlab="Year",ylab="GDP", 
       main="China GDP per Year", 
       col="red", lwd=2, type="p")
```

Likewise, for Canada, the GDP has grown on an annual basis:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(Canada$year, Canada$gdpPercap, xlab="Year",ylab="GDP", 
       main="Canada GDP per Year", 
       col="blue", lwd=2, type="p")
```

However, for Cuba, the GDP has varied wildly.  One can attribute this to political changes and trade sanctions from the US and other nations in the UN.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(Cuba$year, Cuba$gdpPercap, xlab="Year",ylab="GDP", 
       main="Cuba GDP per Year", 
       col="green", lwd=2, type="p")
```


In this section, we will look at the mean, min, and max life expectancies for each continent

As you can see, the smallest population, Africa, has a sizable large and mean population.  The smallest and largest populations in Asia have a very noticable difference. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gap.in %>%
  select(continent, year, pop) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(pop), min = min(pop), max = max(pop))
```  


Now we'll look at some histograms of global life expectancy.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

plot (gap.in$lifeExp, type="h", main="Live Expectancy", xlab="Life Expectancy",ylab="Age in Years")
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
